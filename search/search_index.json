The list can be your starting point to find interesting UU projects, and get inpired and learn from other projects. Is your project also \"awesome\"? Add it to this list (see Contributing ). The initial collection of projects was made based on the collected repositories from the SWORDS-UU project. Repositories were considered when they have a license 25 stars or fulfill 4/5 FAIR criteria. The purpose of this repository is to have a selection of projects that scored high on openness criteria and stars in order to showcase good examples of open practices. In the context of this, awesome refers to projects that showcase the FAIR spirit. This is for example shown in repositories that have a license and a readme file with reuse instructions. In order to promote open science, Utrecht University has launched the Open Science Programme. To add focus to specific topics, there are four tracks within the Programme: Open access, FAIR data and software, Public engagement, Recognition and rewards. This repository was created by efforts of the track of FAIR data and software. Awesome Utrecht University About Research projects with code Research software Research Data Research project management Education and workshops Collaboration Groups Contributing Contact Research projects with code Research projects with supplementing code or data stored on online Git repositories.
